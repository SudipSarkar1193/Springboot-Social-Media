# Xplore - A Full-Stack Social Media Platform

This project is a comprehensive social media application I built to apply the concepts and skills learned during Cognizant's Digital Nurture 4.0 Deep Skilling Program for Java Full Stack Engineering. It serves as a practical demonstration of my ability to design, develop, and deploy a robust, scalable, and feature-rich web application using a modern Java technology stack.

## ‚ú® Features

-   **User Authentication & Security:** Secure user registration with OTP email verification and login functionality using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for stateless authentication.

-   **User Profiles:** Allows users to create and manage their profiles, including updating their full name, bio, and profile picture.

-   **Social Graph:** Users can follow and unfollow others to build their social network and view follower/following lists.

-   **Content Creation:**
    -   **Posts:** Users can create posts with text content and upload multiple images. They can also update and delete their own posts.
    -   **Comments:** Users can add comments to posts, creating threaded discussions.

-   **User Engagement:**
    -   **Likes:** Users can like and unlike posts.
    -   **Sharing:** A share count is tracked for each post.

-   **Real-time Notifications:** Users receive notifications for key events such as new followers, post likes, and comments on their posts, with a real-time unread notification count.

-   **Content Discovery:**
    -   **Personalized Feed:** A main feed that displays posts from users they follow.
    -   **User Suggestions:** A "who to follow" feature to help users discover new connections.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

This project is built with a modern Java stack, incorporating best practices and industry-standard tools as covered in the Digital Nurture 4.0 program.

### Backend
-   **Framework:** Spring Boot 3
-   **Security:** Spring Security (JWT-based authentication)
-   **Data Persistence:** Spring Data JPA with Hibernate as the ORM
-   **API:** Spring Web for creating RESTful services
-   **Database:** Configured to support MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server (with H2 for testing)
-   **Build & Dependency Management:** Maven
-   **Image Storage:** Cloudinary for cloud-based image hosting and management
-   **Email Service:** Spring Mail for sending OTP emails (integrated with Brevo/Sendinblue)
-   **Utilities:** Lombok to reduce boilerplate code, SLF4J for logging
-   **Containerization:** Docker

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites
-   Java 21
-   Apache Maven
-   A relational database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)
-   A Cloudinary account for image storage
-   An SMTP server for sending emails

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/sudipsarkar1193/springboot-social-media.git](https://github.com/sudipsarkar1193/springboot-social-media.git)
    ```

2.  **Configure Environment Variables**

    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the necessary configuration:

    ```ini
    # Database Configuration (example for MySQL)
    DATA_SRC_URL=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/xplore_db
    DB_USERNAME=your_db_user
    DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password

    # JWT Secret Key
    JWT_SECRET=your-very-strong-and-long-jwt-secret-key

    # Cloudinary Credentials
    CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
    CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
    CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret

    # SMTP Credentials (for email service)
    SMTP_USERNAME=your_smtp_username
    SMTP_PASSWORD=your_smtp_password
    ```

3.  **Run the application**
    ```bash
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```
    The API will be available at `http://localhost:8081`.

## üéì Showcasing My Learning from Digital Nurture 4.0

This project is a direct result of the intensive training from the DN 4.0 program. Here‚Äôs how I've applied the key modules:

-   **Design Patterns and Principles (Module 1):** I've applied SOLID principles throughout the application. The separation of concerns between controllers, services, and repositories is a clear example of the Single Responsibility Principle.

-   **Spring Core and Maven (Module 5):** The entire project is built on the Spring Framework and managed with Maven. I've utilized core concepts like Dependency Injection (DI) and Inversion of Control (IoC) to build a loosely coupled and maintainable application.

-   **Spring Data JPA & Hibernate (Module 6):** The persistence layer is built using Spring Data JPA repositories, which significantly simplifies database interactions. Hibernate is used as the JPA provider for object-relational mapping.

-   **Spring REST using Spring Boot 3 (Module 7):** I built a complete RESTful API using `@RestController`. The controllers (PostController, UserController, etc.) handle HTTP requests with mappings like `@GetMapping` and `@PostMapping` to expose the application's features. I also created a GlobalExceptionHandler to manage API error responses and return appropriate HTTP status codes.

-   **Spring Security:** I secured the API using Spring Security. This includes a SecurityConfig class that defines which endpoints are public (/api/auth/**) and which are protected. I implemented stateless authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT), with JwtUtils for token generation/validation and a JwtAuthFilter to process tokens for each request.

-   **Logging Framework (Module 4):** I integrated `SLF4J` for logging throughout the backend, using the @Slf4j annotation in my service and controller classes to record events and errors. I also configured logging levels in the application.properties file.

-   **Version Control (Module 11):** The project is version-controlled with Git, and I've used standard practices for commits and branching.

-   **DevOps & Containerization (Modules 12 & 14):** The inclusion of a Dockerfile demonstrates my ability to containerize the application, a fundamental step in modern DevOps practices for creating consistent and portable deployment environments.

-   **Cloud Fundamentals (Module 13):** I demonstrated my understanding of cloud integration by using `Cloudinary` for image storage. Additionally, I configured the application to use `Microsoft Azure SQL DB` for data persistence, showcasing the practical use of a cloud-based Platform as a Service (PaaS) as covered in the curriculum.
